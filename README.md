# Stuy Scheduler
A little web tool to generate schedule listings in the formats various websites in the Stuyvesant HS community use.

It currently supports the [Andy-Fin Caucus](https://sophomore.stuysu.org) and [today.stuysu.org](today.stuysu.org) database formats, and contributions for new formats are welcomed!

This is a [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) + [MUI](https://mui.com/) project.

## Quickstart

In the project directory, you can run:

Clone the repository and install its dependencies.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/TheEgghead27/stuy-scheduler.git
cd stuy-scheduler
npm install
```
Now you can run the following scripts.

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Our [GitHub Pages](.github/workflows/pages.yml) deployment uses this to deploy the site to https://theegghead27.github.io/stuy-scheduler/.
